The 2 .jar file, cks-slack.jar and sonarqube-community.jar these files were created from open source developers, hence I'm not the copy right owner, use 
at your own will. The slack notifier , is a plugin you can use to send sonarqube notifications to slack and mattermost.

### 
For using sonarqube in your desired repo, in azure-devops pipelines, you can use this link : https://www.apriorit.com/dev-blog/748-qa-integrating-quality-control-into-cicd
There's also a bash script with which you can fetch the project status and fail your build ci/cd pipeline.
